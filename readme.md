# Friday - The Design System

Friday is MobileLIVE's open-source design system for products and digital experiences. With the MobileLIVE Design System as its foundation, the system consists of a working code for multiple frameworks and examples with it.

To combine the code for multiple implementations in the one project we use the monorepos technology [NX](https://github.com/nrwl/nx).

There are several sub-projects with implementations, you can find details by the links below:

* [HTML+CSS](README_STATIC.md)
* [React](README_REACT.md)
* [Angular](README_ANGULAR.md)
