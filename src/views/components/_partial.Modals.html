    <h2>Modal</h2>
    <p>
      A modal is a container in which you can put any kind of content, from text
      to forms to video to an entire grid. Modals are built with HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. Theyâ€™re positioned over everything else in the document and
      remove scroll from the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> so that modal content
      scrolls instead.
